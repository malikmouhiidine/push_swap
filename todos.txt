Note:
    // Turk sort algorithm summary:
    // push two elements to stack b and then assign for each element in stack a a target in stack b 
    // and then find the cheapest node to get to the target by counting the needed operations
    // repeat that until stack a has only 3 elements
    // then sort the 3 elements
    // then do the same thing but with stack b nodes to stack a targets
    // finally make the min on top of stack a
